    "\n",
    "✅ 1. Tracks Program Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Logs help you monitor the flow of your program.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **You can trace what happened and when — useful for debugging and\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **What is memory management in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Ans:- Memory management in Python refers to the process of\n",
    "        allocating and releasing memory to ensure efficient use of\n",
    "        resources while the program runs. Python handles memory\n",
    "        management automatically through its garbage collection\n",
    "        mechanism, but it also provides developers with tools to manage\n",
    "        memory more effectively.**\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- -->\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Python uses automatic garbage collection to free up memory\n",
    "        that is no longer in use (i.e., when objects are no longer\n",
    "        referenced).**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **The garbage collector identifies and removes objects that are\n",
    "        not reachable, preventing memory leaks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Memory Allocation**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **When a variable or object is created, memory is allocated for\n",
    "        it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Python manages this allocation using the heap (for dynamically\n",
    "        created objects) and the stack (for function calls and local\n",
    "        variables).**\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Reference Counting**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Each object in Python has a reference count that tracks the\n",
    "        number of references to the object.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **When the reference count drops to zero (i.e., no more\n",
    "        references), the object is automatically deallocated.**\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Garbage Collection (GC)**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Python uses cyclic garbage collection to handle circular\n",
    "        references (objects referencing each other).**\n",

    "The gc module provides developers the ability to interact with the\n",
    "garbage collector if needed.\n",

    "        unexpectedly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 1. Use try Block\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Wrap the code that might raise an exception inside a try block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \\# Risky code here x = 10 / 0\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. Add except Block(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Catch specific or general exceptions and define what to do when\n",
    "    they occur.**\n",
    "\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(\"You can't divide by zero!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. (Optional) Use else Block\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Executes only if no exceptions occur in the try block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "else:\n",
    "\n",
    "> print(\"No errors occurred.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. (Optional) Use finally Block\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Executes no matter what, whether an exception occurs or not (often\n",
    "    used for cleanup).**\n",

    "> print(\"Execution completed.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Ans:- Memory management is crucial in Python to ensure that\n",
    "        your program runs efficiently, smoothly, and without crashing\n",
    "        due to running out of memory. Even though Python handles memory\n",
    "        automatically, understanding and managing it helps write better,\n",
    "        more scalable code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 1. Prevents Memory Leaks\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Proper memory handling ensures that unused objects don’t stay in\n",
    "    memory forever.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Without it, memory usage would grow unnecessarily, eventually\n",
    "    slowing or crashing the program.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. Improves Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Efficient memory use results in faster execution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Python’s garbage collector and memory manager reduce the time and\n",
    "    effort spent on manual allocation and cleanup.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. Supports Large Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Big projects (e.g., web apps, ML models) use a lot of memory.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Good memory management helps them stay stable and responsive over\n",
    "    time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. Avoids Crashes\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Uncontrolled memory usage can lead to MemoryError or system\n",

    "\n",
    "-   **Python’s memory manager helps avoid such fatal issues by freeing\n",
    "    unused memory.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 5. Enhances Resource Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Makes sure memory is used only when needed, and released when it’s\n",
    "    not — keeping the system resources free for other tasks.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 6. Safer Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Helps prevent bugs caused by uninitialized or corrupted memory.**\n",

    "\n",
    "    -   **The try and except blocks are core components of Python’s\n",

    "✅ 1. try Block\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Used to wrap risky code — the part of your program where an error\n",
    "    might occur.**\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "\n",
    "> x = int(input(\"Enter a number: \")) y = 10 / x\n",

    "-   **Python tries to run the code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **If no error: it proceeds.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **If an error occurs: it jumps to the corresponding except block.**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. except Block\n",
    "\n",
    "Used to catch and handle the error that was raised in the try block.\n",

    "\n",
    "    -   **Ans-** 🔹 **How Python’s Garbage Collection System Works**\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   **Python’s garbage collection (GC) system automatically reclaims\n",
    "        memory by removing objects that are no longer needed, helping\n",

    "\n",
    "✅ 1. Reference Counting (Primary Mechanism)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Every object in Python has a reference count — the number of\n",
    "    variables that point to it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **When an object’s reference count drops to zero, Python\n",
    "    automatically deletes it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "a = \\[1, 2, 3\\] \\# Reference count = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "b = a \\# Reference count = 2\n",
    "\n",
    "del a \\# Reference count = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "del b \\# Reference count = 0 → Collected\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. Garbage Collector for Cyclic References\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Sometimes, objects reference each other in a cycle, so their\n",
    "    reference count never reaches 0 — like:**\n",
    "\n",
    "a = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "b = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "a\\[\"b\"\\] = b\n",
    "\n",
    "b\\[\"a\"\\] = a\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. Generational Garbage Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Python divides objects into 3 generations:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Gen 0: New objects**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Gen 1: Survived one GC cycle**\n",
    "\n",

    "✅ 4. Manual Control (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **You can interact with the GC using the gc module:**\n",
    "\n",

    "⚠ 2. Inefficient Memory Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Python's high-level abstractions (lists, dictionaries, objects)\n",

    "\n",
    "-   **Data structures can become memory-heavy if not optimized.**\n",

    "⚠ 3. Circular References\n",

    "-   **Reference counting alone can’t handle them.**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Python's garbage collector detects and collects these, but it's\n",
    "    not always perfect or fast.**\n",
    "\n",
    "⚠ 4. Unreleased Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Objects like file handles, DB connections, or sockets consume\n",
    "    memory if not explicitly closed.**\n",
    "\n",

    "-   **Keeping large objects in the global scope may delay garbage\n",

    "\n",
