    "\n",
    "    -   🧬 Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a\n",
    "        class (child/subclass) to inherit properties and methods from\n",
    "        another class (parent/superclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "-🧠 In Simple Words:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Inheritance lets you reuse code by allowing one class to take on the\n",
    "    characteristics and behavior of another.\n",
    "\n",
    "-🔗 Real-life Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Vehicle → Base class\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Car, Bike, Truck → Child classes All vehicles have common properties\n",
    "    like engine, wheels, and start(). Instead of rewriting them in every\n",
    "    class, they inherit from Vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧱 Python Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "    -   🔁 Method Overloading is the ability to define multiple methods\n",
    "        with the same name but different parameters in the same class.\n",
    "        However, Python does not support traditional method overloading\n",
    "        (as seen in languages like Java or C++), because Python uses\n",
    "        dynamic typing and does not distinguish methods by the number or\n",
    "        types of their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   But, we can still simulate method overloading in Python by using\n",
    "        default arguments or variable-length argument lists.\n",

    "🔧 Simulating Method Overloading in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "🛠 1. Using Default Arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",
    "\n",

    "1.  # What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   🔄 Method Overriding is the ability of a child class to provide\n",
    "        a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in\n",
    "        its parent class. This allows the child class to modify or\n",
    "        extend the behavior of the parent class's method.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔧 How it Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The parent class defines a method.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The child class redefines that method, but with its own\n",
    "    implementation.\n",

    "-   When you call the method on an object of the child class, the\n",
    "    child's version is executed, not the parent's.\n",

    "\n",
    "    -   🏠 A property decorator in Python allows you to define methods\n",
    "        that behave like attributes. It enables you to access a method\n",

    "1.  # Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   🌐 Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented\n",
    "        Programming (OOP), and it allows different classes to define\n",
    "        methods with the same name but with different behaviors. This\n",
    "        concept plays a crucial role in making OOP flexible, scalable,\n",
    "        and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Why is Polymorphism Crucial? Code Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Polymorphism allows you to write generic code that can work with\n",
    "    objects of different classes. This means you can reuse the same\n",
    "    method in different contexts without rewriting code for each type of\n",
    "    object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Since polymorphism enables different classes to have methods with\n",
    "    the same name, you only need to update a method in one place (the\n",
    "    class). If you want to change how a specific type behaves, you can\n",
    "    simply override the method in that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It makes the code cleaner and more readable. You don’t have to deal\n",
    "    with different function names for each class—just use the same\n",
    "    method name, and the right version gets executed based on the\n",
    "    object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supports Dynamic Behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   With polymorphism, Python can determine at runtime which method to\n",
    "    call, based on the object type. This leads to more flexible and\n",
    "    dynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Promotes Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Polymorphism is great for extending functionality. As you add new\n",
    "    classes, you don’t need to modify existing code—just override\n",
    "    methods in new classes. The existing polymorphic code will continue\n",
    "    to work without changes.\n",

    "1.  # What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   🏆 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) brings several key\n",
    "        advantages that make software development more efficient,\n",
    "        flexible, and manageable. By organizing code into classes and\n",
    "        objects, OOP improves reusability, maintainability, and\n",
    "        scalability of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 1. Modularity:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   OOP breaks down a program into smaller, manageable parts (objects\n",
    "    and classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Each class is like a module, making the code easier to understand,\n",
    "    maintain, and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This promotes separation of concerns (i.e., each class handles its\n",
    "    own specific functionality).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 2. Reusability:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Through inheritance, you can reuse existing code (methods and\n",
    "    properties) without having to rewrite it.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Once a class is written and tested, it can be reused in different\n",
    "    programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This leads to less code duplication and saves time in future\n",
    "    development.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 3. Flexibility and Extensibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Polymorphism allows you to use the same method name for different\n",
    "    object types.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   You can extend existing classes (using inheritance) without altering\n",
    "    the original code, making it easy to introduce new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This leads to flexible systems that can adapt to new requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ 4. Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Encapsulation keeps the internal state of an object hidden and only\n",
    "    exposes a public interface (via methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "-   This helps to protect data and ensures that an object’s internal\n",
    "    state is not changed unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It also makes it easier to debug since you can isolate issues within\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "🔧 How Multiple Inheritance Works in Python:\n",

    "-   Python supports multiple inheritance by allowing a class to inherit\n",

    "\n",
    "    -   Use case: It should return a string that is easy to read and\n",

    "2.  **repr** Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Purpose: The **repr** method is used to define the formal or\n",

    "    ensure that the correct method from the parent class is called,\n",

    "\n",
    "Avoiding Explicit Parent Class Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Using super() ensures that the child class code is more maintainable\n",
    "    and extensible because it doesn't rely on hardcoded parent class\n",
    "    names. This is particularly helpful when you change the parent class\n",

    "-   super() is often used in the **init** method of a child class to\n",
